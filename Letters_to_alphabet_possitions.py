# Kata: Replace with alphabet position

# In this ka ta you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
# If anything is the text is not a letter, ignore it and do not return it.

# Input - string, sentence 
# Output - letters number by it is possition in alphabet with gab between each number

# Main used idea : nested list - list inside a list |
